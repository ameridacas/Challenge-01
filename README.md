# Semantic_HTML_Element_Page
#Description

I was given a web page that had non-semantic elements such as divs and class selectors. The HTML and CSS code needed to be consolidated with semantic elements such as header, footer, navigation, section, and articles. I changed the divs and class selectors to those semantic elements. Any changes made to the HTML were mirrored to the CSS style sheet to avoid code errors. I grouped up the HTML/CSS by removing extra code first then, I grouped some classes under a single name called benefit-rule while making sure everything functioned normally. The main objective was to consolidate the HTML code while keeping the webpage visually the same.

#Usage

The Semantic HTML page can be used for better organization and understanding of code instead of using non-semantic elements such as divs or class selectors. The html contains straight forward semantic elemements such as header,footer, navigation, section and articles. Providing a simpler template for the consumer.
